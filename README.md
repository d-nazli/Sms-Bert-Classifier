📩 SMS BERT Classifier

BERT-based SMS Classification System

This project focuses on classifying SMS messages using BERT-based deep learning models to distinguish between different message categories .

The system applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based architectures to learn semantic patterns from text data and make accurate predictions.
